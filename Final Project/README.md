# Final Project

## Introduction

**The term project reflects 20% of your final grade.**  

**This is a group project.**  

This document provides a basic skeleton for the project. Specific details regarding expected deliverables will be posted on Blackboard as separate assignments.

## Learning Objectives

- Creating a relational schema for given data
- Bulk load data using python
- Build a dashboard that displays data visualizations

## Overview

In this project you will create a relational schema and a MySQL database for a dataset of your choice. You will also implement/create a dashboard that displays five different visualizations of your dataset using a Jupyter notebook (see [example](https://www.kaggle.com/benhammer/python-data-visualizations)).  

This project has three milestones:  

**Milestone 1 (due Oct 26th):** Write a proposal to  

1. Identify your dataset
2. Propose a design for your dashboard visual
3. Create a database schema for your dataset, normalize the database, and create a relational schema

## Datasets

Here are some sources of data and criteria for an acceptable dataset:  

An acceptable dataset must:

1. Yield at least five different tables
2. The data is connected such that there is only one or two standalone tables
