## Course Description

Students are introduced to the theory and application of database systems. Topics include data modeling and the relational model, query languages, relational database design, transaction processing, databases and physical database design.

## Tools Used

As this course was a databases course, we primarily learned how to use SQL and MySQLWorkbench for working with actual SQL queries. We also were required to use Python for linking our SQL databases and creating a functional dashboard using the data we pulled.
